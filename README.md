# NES-Hub

The NES Hub is a peripheral that plugs into the expansion port of NES-001 consoles.

It brings Bluetooth functionality to the NES, powered by the great open source project Blueretro by Darthcloud.
Through that, its possible to connect basically any BT Controller, including the NES Switch controllers. It also supports 4 controllers by emulating a FourScore Adapter.

Expansion Audio can be enabled, either by using EXP2, EXP6 or EXP9, using a DIP-switch.

On top of that, most signals available on the Expansion Port are broken out to 3 Mini Displayport connectors, grouped by controller signals, EXP signals and CPU signals. I wanted to make these signals available for anyone who wants to have a go at developing addons or just wants to tinker with them.
The pinouts of these connectors are attached as an excel file.
My own (basic) addon is an adapter for SNES and famicom controllers using the port with the controller signals.

IÂ´m open for suggestions Ideas for other addons and happy to help and test if anybody wants to develop something.
