The NES Hub is a peripheral that plugs into the expansion port of NES-001 (frontloader) consoles.

It brings Bluetooth functionality to the NES, powered by the great open source project [BlueRetro](https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro) by [Darthcloud](https://x.com/darthcloud64).
Through that, its possible to connect basically any BT Controller, including the Switch NES controllers. It supports 4 controllers by emulating a FourScore Adapter.

Expansion Audio can be enabled, either by using EXP2, EXP6 or EXP9, using a DIP-switch.

On top of that, most signals available on the Expansion Port are broken out to 3 Mini Displayport connectors, grouped by controller signals, EXP signals and CPU signals. These pinouts are available here for anyone who wants to have a go at developing addons or just wants to tinker with them.

My own (basic) addon is an adapter for SNES and famicom controllers using the port with the controller signals.

IÂ´m open for suggestions and Ideas for other addons and happy to help and test if anybody wants to develop something.
